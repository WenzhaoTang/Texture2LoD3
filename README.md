# ReLoD3 Texturing

Welcome to the draft version of our code for experiments in the ReLoD3 Texturing project! This project focuses on various techniques for enhancing 3D building models. Below are the key components of the project:

## LoD3 Building Extraction
Extract detailed Level of Detail 3 (LoD3) building models from various data sources.

## Cluster Small Triangular Faces
Group small triangular faces to simplify the 3D model and improve performance.

## Morphological Adaptation
Apply morphological operations to adapt and refine the 3D building models.

## Texturing
Add realistic textures to the 3D models to enhance visual appearance.
