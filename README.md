# ReLoD3 Texturing

Welcome to the draft version of our code for experiments in the ReLoD3 Texturing project! This project focuses on various techniques for enhancing 3D building models. Below are the key components of the project:

## Step 0: LoD3 Building Extraction
Extract detailed Level of Detail 3 (LoD3) building models from various data sources.

## Step 1: Cluster Small Triangular Faces
Group small triangular faces to simplify the 3D model and improve performance.

## Step 2: Rectification and Stitching
Rectify and stitch the image tiles of WallSurface to create a seamless texture.

## Step 3: Instance Segmentation
Segment the the Steiched and Rectified images of WallSurface

## Step 4: Morphological Adaptation
Apply morphological operations to adapt and refine the 3D building models.

## Step 5: Texturing
Utilize ray tracing and texture mapping techniques to apply WallSurface textures to the 3D building models.

## Step 6: Evaluation
SSIM and PSNR evaluation of the generated textures.

## Misc. Revised Code from NUS TEAM
The revised code from NUS team is available in the `footprints` folder, with missing geo-data calculation and Panaroma images extraction script integrated.
